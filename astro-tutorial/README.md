# Astro OSSI site

## Overview

This version of the OSSI site is built with [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro), following the [Astro "Build a blog" tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) and then integrating components from the [Astrowind](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind/tree/main) template.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
