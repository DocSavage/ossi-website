The goal of this project is to develop a packaging tool chain for tools with JVM and non-JVM dependencies, and to establish standardized distribution channels for these tools at Janelia. The proposed efforts will make installation easier, more reliable for end-users, and thereby reduce long-term software maintenance costs for developers while improving the user experience as well as the visibility and accessibility of the tool. The reproducibility of scientific software will be improved, as software will be less likely to break, e.g. due to version skew. While the initial focus will be tools developed and distributed at Janelia, the results are expected to translate seamlessly to the wider open source community and will simplify the distribution of such tools worldwide.
