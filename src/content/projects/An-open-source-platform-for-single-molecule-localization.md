Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), has revolutionized biology as it extends the resolution of light microscopy by up to 50-fold. SMLM, and related techniques like single particle tracking, single molecule FISH and in situ sequencing depend on advanced analysis algorithms a) to determine the precise positions of single fluorophores in the camera images, b) to visualize the data in 2D and 3D and c) to extract quantitative measures from the specific data (point-clouds, coordinates of fluorophores with uncertainties) to drive biological interpretation.

We propose to develop a complete python-based user-friendly GUI-based open source platform for single-molecule localization that will become the standard software for SMLM and targets various end-user applications.
