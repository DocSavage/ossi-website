NeuronBridge is a web-based service for neuron matching and searching in Drosophila melanogaster. It indexes large data sets of LM and EM imagery to enable finding similar neurons across modalities and data sets. The production site is available at [https://neuronbridge.janelia.org](https://neuronbridge.janelia.org).
