[HortaCloud](https://hortacloud.janelia.org) is a collaborative neuron annotation environment that was originally built for the [MouseLight Team Project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight). You can read more about HortaCloud on its [home page](https://hortacloud.janelia.org), which includes a complete deployment guide and user manual.
