          About the Janelia Open Science Software Initiative
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="content">
          Open-source code and software are immensely important to progress in
          all areas of science. Sharing code allows the same analyses to be
          performed across labs, facilitates wide-spread use of computational
          tools that are increasingly important in biology, and enables for
          different groups to build on top of others’ achievements.
          Additionally, the transparency that open-source code provides creates
          trust in results produced by scientific software.
          <br /><br />
          The challenge at Janelia is not to convince researchers that they should
          share their code but to help them do this as efficiently and productively
          as possible. Importantly, sharing code successfully requires more than
          just releasing it as-is under an open license. Only well-designed and well-
          documented code is easy to reuse or modify for new applications by other
          developers (developer-friendly), which usually constitutes significant
          efforts. Similarly hard is the design of intuitive user interfaces that
          allow scientists without expert knowledge of the underlying algorithms
          to use the software (user-friendly). Additionally, sustained long-term
          effort is often required to support such code and software over its lifetime
          -- providing user support, fixing bugs, and maintaining the code. These
          efforts are not yet reliably recognized as part of scientists’ career-related
          work, particularly outside of Janelia, although they can easily take the
          majority of time spent on any project involving software. This forces many
          scientists to carefully balance between creating widely useful code/software
          and moving on to the next project. Therefore, the <a

          In regular intervals we are inviting proposals for Open-Source
          Software projects from scientists at Janelia. The aim of a proposal
          should generally be to develop, maintain and/or document
          developer-friendly, user-friendly code that promises to have a
          significant impact on the community.
